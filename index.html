            <ul id="tribute-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>1914</strong> -Born in Cresco, Iowa
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1933</strong> -Leaves his family's farm to 
                    attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression 
                    era program known as the "National Youth Administration"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1938</strong> -Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. 
                    Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, 
                    he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about 
                    breeding pest-resistent plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1944</strong> -Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, 
                    leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new 
                    plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 
                    6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including 
                    different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world 
                    food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are 
                    the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. 
                    Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've 
                    been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. 
                    Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best 
                    breeds."

                <li>
                    <strong>2009</strong> -dies at the age of 95.

                    scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
